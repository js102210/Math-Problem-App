Web App to produce sets of ten basic math problems and show a score for the number correct

Developed in a team as part of Tech Elevator coursework. Web app that produces sets of ten basic math problems. User selects between addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Set of problems produced will contain a random mix of ten problems. Each problem will have two operands, which are randomly selected from between 0 and 9. 4 choices are presented for selection, one correct and the other three incorrect. Incorrect choices are always possible outputs considering the operator and operands 0-9 (for example, possible incorrect choices for a multiplication problem always range between -81 and 81).

User is presented with a score of correct answers out of ten at the end of each problem set.
